# Notebooks-for-Student-Performance-Predictor

Broadly ipynbs on EDA and Model Training, but also data for the Gradient-Boosting algorithm used in the web app project [Student-Performance-Predictor](https://github.com/GBlanch/Student-Performance-Predictor)
This data is mainly csv and tsv flat files, with a json file on the performed training stage for the CatBoost method.

The dataset is compound by around a thousand observations. [Dataset Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)
